--------

## Download raw data
To create or update the Conda environment and run the data download script, use the following command:
```bash
make data
```

This will:

- Check if the Conda environment named `aio_p51_house_price` exists.
- If it exists, update it according to `environment.yml`.
- If it doesn't exist, create a new environment from `environment.yml`.
- Activate the Conda environment.
- Run the data download script at `src/dataset.py`.
- The script will download a file from Google Drive and save it to  
  `./data/raw/train-house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques.csv`

## Data description
